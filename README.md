Crowdfunding Data Management

Overview:

This project aims to organize crowdfunding data into a structured database. It involves extracting, transforming, and loading data from Excel files into CSV files and finally into a PostgreSQL database.

Instructions:

Create Category and Subcategory DataFrames: 

Extract and transform data from the crowdfunding.xlsx file to create category.csv and subcategory.csv. These files contain unique categories and subcategories respectively.

Create Campaign DataFrame: 

Extract and transform data from crowdfunding.xlsx to create campaign.csv, containing campaign details like company name, goal, outcome, etc.

Create Contacts DataFrame: 

Extract and transform data from contacts.xlsx either using Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to create contacts.csv.

Create Crowdfunding Database: 

Design an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) based on CSV files. Save the database schema as crowdfunding_db_schema.sql and create the crowdfunding_db PostgreSQL database. Import CSV files into corresponding SQL tables.
